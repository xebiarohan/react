# Basics

1. We can import the Javascipt files in HTML using the 'script' tag.
   - we can place it in head, body

2. We use defer to let the data present in the body load before the script loading

```
   <script src="assets/scripts/app.js" defer></script>
```

3. we can use module type in a script that will consider the script as a seperate module.
   - It helps in importing code from script A to script B
   - we can export from 1 script and can import into another

```
   <script src="assets/scripts/app.js" type="module"></script>
```

4. we can export as many items as we want like variable, functions, etc but we can have max of 1 default export in a class

```
export let apiKey = 'fnjsklmfshsdlmfsfjrppskkrso';

export default 'skefnseflns';
```

5. If we have multiple items to import from a file, we can import them togather

```
import * as Util from './util.js'
```

6. Default value of a variable in a function call

```
function greet(username, message='Hello') {
   console.log(message + ' ' + username);
}

greet('max');
```

7. Object

```
const user = {
   name: 'Max',
   age: 34,
   greet() {
      console.log('hello');
   }
}

user.greet();
```

8. Class

```

class User {
    constructor(name, age) {
        this.age = age;
        this.name = name;
    }

    greet() {
        console.log('Hello');
    }
}

const user1 = new User('Max', 35);
```

9. Destructuring
    - In array destructuring we can name variables anything we want
    - In object destructuring we have to keep the same name as the property name or we have to keep an alias

```
const [firstName,age] = ['max',34]   // array restructuring

const {name, age} = {name: 'max', age: 34}   // object destructuring

const {name: username, age} = {name: 'max', age: 34}   // object destructuring with alias
```

10. Spread operator

```
const user = {name: 'max', age: 34};

const extendedUser = {isAdmin: true, ... user};

```

11. Function inside function

```

function init() {
    function greet() {
        console.log('Hello');
    }

    greet();
}

init();     // Hello
```

12. React build process
    - Converts the react code (JSX) into deployable code (js files)

```
React code ---> BUILD PROCESS ---> Deployable files on browser

```

13. Public folder
    - All the files in the public folder are server along with index.html at the same level
    - So if there is some files in public folder, we can refer to that in index.html directly
    - Any file like images stored in the public folder can be directly accessed from the browser like
    - localhost:5173/some-image.jpg
    - So if we have to use some image for index.html page then we can keep it in public folder
    - Images that are used by the components should typically be stored inside assets

14. Strict mode
    - Component to import from React
    - We can use anywhere in our component, here we are using it in Index.jsx
    - Strict mode renders the application twice that helps find some errors

```
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import { StrictMode } from "react";

import App from "./App.jsx";
import "./index.css";

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <App />
  </StrictMode>
);

```


15. HTML elements
   - menu
   - article
   - pre
   - code
   - main
   - aside
   - dialog with <form method="dialog">
        <button>Close</button>
      </form>

16. Javascript concepts
    - clearInterval
    - clearTimeout
