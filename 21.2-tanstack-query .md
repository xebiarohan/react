## Tanstack Query II

1. Refetch none in `useMutation` hook
   - When we invalidate the queries, it immediately tries to refetch the data again
   - So if we are on an event and try to delete that event, then it will give 404
   - As we just deleted it and tries to refetch the same because its `queryKey` matches the `queryKey` that we passed in the invalidate queries object
   - So we can do `refetchType` none.
   - It will only refetch when we go to that page or call that endpoint again, not on its own


```
useMutation({
    mutationFn: deleteEvent,
    onSuccess: () => {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["events"], refetchType: 'none' });
      navigate("/events");
    },
  });
```

2. Modal example

```
export default function Modal({ children, onClose }) {
  const dialog = useRef();

  useEffect(() => {
    const modal = dialog.current;
    modal.showModal();

    return () => {
      modal.close(); 
    };
  }, []);

  return createPortal(
    <dialog className="modal" ref={dialog} onClose={onClose}>
      {children}
    </dialog>,
    document.getElementById('modal')
  );
}


```
