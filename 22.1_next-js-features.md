#Next.js other features and syntax

1. Importing image and using it
    - In react we can import an image and can directly use it
    - In Next.js we have to do the same import but while using it we have to use the `src` property 

```
import logoImg from './assets/logo.png;


export default function MainHeader() {
  return (
    <header>
      <Link href="/">
        <img src={logoImg.src} alt="A plate with food on it" />
        Next Level Food
      </Link>
    </header>  
  );
}
```

2. Tailwind is the most popular framework for `Next.JS`, But CSS modules are also used.

3. Image element
   - `Next.JS` provides a special element `Image` to use images in components
   - This element has a lot of props and configuration that we can provide to it.
   - We have to pass the whole object instead of `src` only
   - It loads image lazily means loads the image only when it is needed.
   - Priority is to load the image on priority when needed

```
import logoImg from './assets/logo.png;


export default function MainHeader() {
  return (
    <header>
      <Link href="/">
        <Image src={logoImg} alt="A plate with food on it" priority/>
        Next Level Food
      </Link>
    </header>  
  );
}
```
