#Next.js other features and syntax

1. Importing image and using it
    - In react we can import an image and can directly use it
    - In Next.js we have to do the same import but while using it we have to use the `src` property 

```
import logoImg from './assets/logo.png;


export default function MainHeader() {
  return (
    <header>
      <Link href="/">
        <img src={logoImg.src} alt="A plate with food on it" />
        Next Level Food
      </Link>
    </header>  
  );
}
```

2. Tailwind is the most popular framework for `Next.JS`, But CSS modules are also used.

3. Image element
   - `Next.JS` provides a special element `Image` to use images in components
   - This element has a lot of props and configuration that we can provide to it.
   - We have to pass the whole object instead of `src` only
   - It loads image lazily means loads the image only when it is needed.
   - Priority is to load the image on priority when needed

```
import logoImg from './assets/logo.png;


export default function MainHeader() {
  return (
    <header>
      <Link href="/">
        <Image src={logoImg} alt="A plate with food on it" priority/>
        Next Level Food
      </Link>
    </header>  
  );
}
```

4. We cannot directly have selector type of CSS in module CSS classes like h1, div. It needs to be in some other CSS class like

``` Not allowed
h1 {                        
  color: 'white'              
}

```

```
.div-sections h1 {
  color: 'white'
}

```

5. React server components vs Client components
   - By default in `Next.JS` all the components are React server components means they get rendered on server.
   - Only the finished HTML code that is transferred to the client
   - We can have client side components in `Next.JS`
   - They are pre-rendered on the server and then also potentially render on the client.
   - Hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` are not available on the server components
   - Event handlers are also not available in server components like `onClick`, `onChange`.
   - We can use `use client` directive in component to make a server side component to a client side component

```
'use client';

import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import Image from 'next/image';

import burgerImg from '@/assets/burger.jpg';
import curryImg from '@/assets/curry.jpg';
import dumplingsImg from '@/assets/dumplings.jpg';

```
