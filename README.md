# react

A javascript library for building user interfaces

1. React vs Javascript
   - React uses Javascript only
   - but maintaining Javascript code for complex application is cumbersome, error-prone and hard to maintain
   - React provide easy syntax to do the same work

2. Creating react project
   - Using tools like Vite

```
# npm 7+, extra double-dash is needed:
npm create vite@latest my-vue-app -- --template react
```

3. React uses JSX (HTML in javascript) that is why we need a build tool, that can change this jsx to pure javascript before running it on the browser.
